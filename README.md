# Analyzing Physical Impacts using Transient Surface Wave Imaging

This repo contains the official code and data for our CVPR 2023 paper: [Analyzing Physical Impacts using Transient Surface Wave Imaging](add link to paper).  For more demos, please see [Project Page](xxx)

## How to run 

Users can start install basica packages for data processing: 

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

All python code are put in `src`, and users can follow `LocalizationMain.ipynb` to perform impact localization, and `PingpngDemo.ipynb` to recreate Figure-9 in the main paper. 

For the data, please jump to `data/README.md`[add link later] for more info.
